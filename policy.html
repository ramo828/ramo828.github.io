  <h1>Privacy Policy — <strong>Nömrə satışı v2</strong></h1>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 7, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>Nömrə satışı v2</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), developed by <strong>BlackCatEmirates</strong>, collects, uses, discloses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (package name: <code>com.ramosoft.numb_v5_1</code>). This policy covers personal data collected directly from you, data collected automatically via third-party services (e.g., Google AdMob, Firebase), how we use that data, and your rights regarding that data. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. What this App Does</h2>
  <p>Nömrə satışı v2 queries mobile operator APIs to retrieve information (e.g., phone numbers, subscriber details) and delivers results to users. The App supports user accounts (registration and login), displays banner advertisements via Google AdMob, and saves retrieved data to device storage in formats such as txt, vcf, or csv for user convenience.</p>

  <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Personal Data You Provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full name</strong> (first and last name) — for user account creation.</li>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong> — for account management and communication.</li>
    <li><strong>Phone number</strong> — for account verification and core functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Password</strong> — used for authentication. <em>We do not store plain-text passwords.</em> Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication, and we do not have access to your plain-text password.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Data Collected Automatically</h3>
  <p>When you use the App or its integrated services, the following data may be collected automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (e.g., Advertising ID for ad personalization; note: Android ID is not used as a persistent identifier).</li>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> and derived approximate location (used for analytics and ad delivery).</li>
    <li><strong>Usage and diagnostic data</strong> (e.g., app launches, crash reports, performance metrics, feature usage).</li>
    <li><strong>Log data</strong> and network request timestamps.</li>
    <li><strong>Files and documents</strong> (e.g., txt, vcf, csv files created by the App to store API-retrieved data on your device).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Data Collected via Mobile Operator APIs</h3>
  <p>The App queries mobile operator APIs to retrieve data such as phone numbers or subscriber details. This data is used to provide the App’s core functionality and may be saved to your device in txt, vcf, or csv formats at your request. We do not collect sensitive personal information beyond what is necessary for the App's functionality.</p>

  <h3>3.4 Third-Party Data Collection (via SDKs)</h3>
  <p>The App uses third-party services (listed below) that may collect and process some of the above data types per their own privacy policies:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong>: For serving banner ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase (Google LLC)</strong>: For authentication, data storage, and analytics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We verify that these third-party services comply with applicable privacy laws and Google Play policies.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To create and manage user accounts and authenticate users (Firebase Authentication).</li>
    <li>To store and retrieve profile and account data (Firebase Cloud Firestore).</li>
    <li>To query mobile operator APIs and deliver results to users, including saving data to device storage (txt, vcf, csv) upon user request.</li>
    <li>To serve advertisements via Google AdMob and enable ad personalization where permitted.</li>
    <li>To analyze and improve the App’s performance and stability (Firebase Analytics).</li>
    <li>To respond to user requests, questions, and support inquiries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Permissions Used</h2>
  <p>The App requires the following Android permissions to function properly. These permissions are requested only when necessary and are justified as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Storage Permissions</strong> (<code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>, <code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>): To save API-retrieved data (e.g., phone numbers, subscriber details) to your device in txt, vcf, or csv formats. Access is limited to app-specific files and does not include broad photo or video access.</li>
    <li><strong>Internet and Network Permissions</strong> (<code>INTERNET</code>, <code>ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE</code>): To connect to mobile operator APIs and serve ads via AdMob.</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising ID Permission</strong> (<code>com.google.android.gms.permission.AD_ID</code>): To enable personalized ads through Google AdMob.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Legal Basis for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, we process personal data based on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong>: For personalized ads, data storage on your device, and certain data transfers (where required, e.g., under GDPR).</li>
    <li><strong>Contract</strong>: To provide App functionality and account services.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong>: To improve the App, prevent abuse, and serve ads (balanced against your rights).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Advertising & Google AdMob</h2>
  <p>We use Google AdMob to display banner ads. AdMob and its partners may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising ID (for ad personalization).</li>
    <li>Device and connection information.</li>
    <li>IP address (for approximate location).</li>
    <li>Usage data (e.g., ad interactions).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AdMob may deliver personalized ads where permitted. You can opt out of personalized ads via device settings (reset or limit Advertising ID) or through Google’s ad settings: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Opt out of personalized ads</a>. In regions requiring consent (e.g., EU/EEA), we provide an in-app consent option. Opting out reduces personalization but does not remove ads. We do not sell your personal data.</p>

  <h2>8. Firebase & Data Storage</h2>
  <p>We use Firebase (Google LLC) for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Firebase Authentication</strong>: To manage user sign-in.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Cloud Firestore</strong>: To store user profiles and related data.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong>: To monitor app performance and usage.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> store plain-text passwords; credential management is handled by Firebase Authentication. See Firebase’s privacy documentation: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>9. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data. Data is shared only as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google services</strong>: Firebase and AdMob process data for hosting, analytics, authentication, and ad serving, per their policies.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong>: Trusted vendors for analytics, crash reporting, or support, bound by contracts to protect your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requests</strong>: To comply with legal obligations or protect rights, safety, or property.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App’s services (typically up to 30 days after deletion request). Data saved to your device (e.g., txt, vcf, csv files) remains until you delete it. Usage and diagnostic data are retained for up to 90 days for analytics purposes. We also retain data as required by law or to resolve disputes.</p>

  <h2>11. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your data may be transferred to servers outside your country (e.g., Google’s servers in the US). We rely on Google’s data protection measures, such as Standard Contractual Clauses, and comply with frameworks like the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. By using the App, you consent to such transfers, where applicable. In regions like the EU/EEA, we provide an in-app consent option for data transfers.</p>

  <h2>12. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable measures to protect your data, including HTTPS/TLS encryption for data in transit and access controls for stored data. Files saved on your device (txt, vcf, csv) are managed by your device’s security settings. No method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>13. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction (e.g., under GDPR, CCPA, or similar laws), you may have the following rights:</p>
