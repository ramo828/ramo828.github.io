  <h1>Privacy Policy — <strong>numb_v5_1</strong></h1>
  <p class="lead"><strong>Last updated:</strong> September 6, 2025</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>numb_v5_1</strong> (the “App”, “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, discloses and protects your information when you use our mobile application. This policy covers the personal data we collect directly from you, data collected automatically by the services we use (for example Google AdMob and Firebase), how we use that data, and your rights regarding that data.</p>

  <h2>1. Controller / Contact</h2>
  <p><strong>Data controller:</strong> numb_v5_1</p>
  <p><strong>Contact email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ramosoft94@gmail.com">ramosoft94@gmail.com</a></p>

  <h2>2. What this App Does</h2>
  <p>numb_v5_1 collects and uses data to provide the service: it queries mobile operator APIs to obtain information and delivers results to users. The App also supports user accounts (registration & login), and displays banner advertisements via Google AdMob.</p>

  <h2>3. Data We Collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Personal Data you provide</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full name</strong> (first and last name)</li>
    <li><strong>Email address</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Phone number</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Password</strong> — used for authentication. <em>We do not store your plain-text password in Firestore.</em> Authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication; we do not have access to your plain-text password.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.2 Data collected automatically</h3>
  <p>When you use the App or the services we rely on, the following data may be collected automatically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> (including the Advertising ID used by ad SDKs)</li>
    <li><strong>IP address</strong> and derived approximate location (used for analytics and ad delivery)</li>
    <li><strong>Usage and diagnostic data</strong> (app launches, crash reports, performance metrics, feature usage)</li>
    <li><strong>Log data</strong> and network request timestamps</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3.3 Third-party data collection (via SDKs)</h3>
  <p>The App uses third-party services (listed below) which may collect and process some of the data types above according to their own privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>4. How We Use Your Data</h2>
  <p>We use the collected data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To create and manage your user account and to authenticate you (Firebase Authentication).</li>
    <li>To store and retrieve your profile and account data (Firebase Cloud Firestore).</li>
    <li>To provide the App’s core functionality that uses mobile operator APIs and returns results to you.</li>
    <li>To serve advertisements (Google AdMob) and to enable ad personalization where permitted.</li>
    <li>To analyze and improve the App’s performance and stability.</li>
    <li>To respond to your requests, questions, and support inquiries.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal Basis for Processing (where applicable)</h2>
  <p>Depending on the jurisdiction, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases to process personal data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your consent (where required) — for example, if you consent to personalized ads.</li>
    <li>Performance of a contract — to provide the App and account services.</li>
    <li>Legitimate interests — to improve the App, prevent abuse, and serve ads (balanced against user rights).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Advertising & Google AdMob</h2>
  <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display banner ads in the App. AdMob and its partners may collect data for ad selection and measurement, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Advertising identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)</li>
    <li>Device and connection information</li>
    <li>IP address (used for approximate location)</li>
    <li>Usage data (events, engagement)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>AdMob may use this data to deliver personalized ads. If you do not want personalized ads, you can opt out via your device settings (reset or limit Advertising ID) or follow Google’s ad settings: <a href="https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Opt out of personalized ads</a>. Note: opting out reduces advertising personalization but does not remove ads entirely.</p>

  <h2>7. Firebase & Data Storage</h2>
  <p>The App is integrated with Firebase (Google LLC) services. We use Firebase Authentication for user sign-in and Firebase Cloud Firestore to store user profile and related data. We do <strong>not</strong> store user plain text passwords in Firestore; credential management is handled by Firebase Authentication. See Firebase’s privacy documentation for details: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h2>8. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties. Your data is shared only in the following limited ways:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google services:</strong> Firebase and AdMob process data as described in their policies to provide hosting, analytics, authentication and ad serving.</li>
    <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> We may use trusted third-party vendors for analytics, crash reporting or customer support; they only process data to provide services to us and are bound by contract to protect your data.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> We may disclose information to comply with legal obligations or to protect rights, safety or property.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the App and fulfill the purposes described in this policy, or until you request deletion of your account and data. Usage and diagnostic data may be retained for a shorter period for analytics and performance monitoring. We also retain data as necessary to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>

  <h2>10. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and stored on servers located outside your country of residence (for example, Google’s servers). Where data is transferred across borders, we rely on Google’s data protection measures and any applicable legal safeguards. By using the App you consent to such transfers as described in this policy.</p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable administrative, technical and physical measures designed to protect data from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. These include encrypted transport (HTTPS/TLS) and access controls. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>12. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> Request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request correction of inaccurate or incomplete data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Request deletion of your account and personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Restriction / Objection:</strong> Object to or request restriction of certain processing (for example, targeted advertising).</li>
    <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> Request a machine-readable copy of certain personal data.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To exercise any of these rights, contact us via email at <a href="mailto:ramosoft94@gmail.com">ramosoft94@gmail.com</a>. We will respond to verifiable requests in accordance with applicable law. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling a request.</p>

  <h2>13. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information of a child under 13 without parental consent, we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

  <h2>14. Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>The App may include links to third-party websites or services. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those third-party services; you should review their privacy policies separately.</p>

  <h2>15. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of this page and post the modified policy. If changes are material, we may notify you by email (if you provided one) or via an in-app notice.</p>

  <h2>16. Play Store / Data Safety (Brief guidance)</h2>
  <p>When completing Google Play Console’s Data Safety form, the App will typically require the following selections:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data collected:</strong> Personal info (Name, Email, Phone), Device or other IDs (Advertising ID), Usage & diagnostics, IP address (may be listed under “Other”).</li>
    <li><strong>Data shared:</strong> Shared with service providers and Google (Firebase, AdMob).</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> App functionality, analytics, advertising, authentication.</li>
