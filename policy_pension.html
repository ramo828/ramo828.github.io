      <section id="overview">
        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Pension Calculator is a simple mobile application that provides estimated pension information based on user inputs (salary history, contribution rate, retirement age, etc.). This Policy explains what information the App collects, why it collects that information, how it is used, with whom it is shared, and what control you have over your information.
        </p>
        <p class="muted"><strong>Important:</strong> The App does not require account registration and does not collect passwords or full names unless you voluntarily enter them into free-text fields (which the App generally does not require).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="data">
        <h2>2. Data we collect</h2>
        <p>We minimize data collection to what is necessary for analytics, app operation and ad delivery. Categories of data collected:</p>

        <h3>2.1. Data you provide directly</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Input data for pension estimates:</strong> numeric values such as salary figures, contribution percentages, retirement age. These values are used only to calculate your pension estimate and are not used to identify you.</li>
          <li><strong>Support & feedback:</strong> if you send an email or feedback message, that content and your email address will be retained to respond.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.2. Automatically-collected technical data (Firebase Analytics)</h3>
        <p>
          We use <strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> to collect aggregated and anonymous usage and performance data such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>App metrics: sessions, screens visited, feature usage, crash reports and performance traces.</li>
          <li>Device metadata: device model, OS version, locale, app version, language.</li>
          <li>Anonymous identifiers issued by Firebase or Google services (non-personally-identifying).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">Purpose: to improve app stability, diagnose crashes, and enhance the user experience. For Firebase privacy details see the official Firebase privacy documentation.</p>

        <h3>2.3. Advertising identifiers / ad-related data (Google Mobile Ads)</h3>
        <p>
          We display ads in the App via Google mobile ad services (Google Mobile Ads / AdMob). These ad providers may collect advertising identifiers (for Android: Advertising ID) and ad interaction data (impressions, clicks) to serve and measure ads.
        </p>
        <p class="muted">You can reset or delete your Advertising ID from your device settings; you can also control ad personalization via Google's Ad Settings. See <em>How to control / opt out</em> below for links and instructions.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="use">
        <h2>3. How we use data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To perform the App’s core functionality — calculating and displaying estimated pension amounts based on user inputs.</li>
          <li>To measure and analyze app usage and performance (Firebase Analytics) so we can fix crashes, improve features, and prioritize updates.</li>
          <li>To display and measure advertising (Google Mobile Ads / AdSense) and support revenue generation that keeps the App free.</li>
          <li>To respond to support requests and communications you send to us (by email).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal bases (for users in the EEA / UK)</h3>
        <p class="muted">If you are an EU/EEA user, our lawful bases for processing are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Performance of a contract:</strong> processing necessary to provide the App’s functionality when relevant.</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> analyzing aggregated usage data, improving the App and securing the App (we balance these interests against user rights).</li>
          <li><strong>Consent:</strong> where required (for personalized advertising), we rely on explicit consent mechanisms implemented in the App (or device-level consent on iOS with App Tracking Transparency).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="sharing">
        <h2>4. Sharing & third parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google / Firebase:</strong> analytics and crash reporting. Firebase processes data on our behalf as a service provider.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads / Ad networks:</strong> ad serving, measurement and fraud prevention. Ad networks may independently collect identifiers and other signals for ad personalization.</li>
          <li><strong>Law enforcement or legal requests:</strong> when required by law or to protect rights, safety or property.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">Third-party providers have their own privacy practices. We encourage you to review their privacy policies (links in the "Sources" section below).</p>
      </section>

      <section id="retention">
        <h2>5. Data retention</h2>
        <p>We retain analytics and ad-related data according to the retention policies of the third-party providers. For example, Google Analytics/Firebase data retention settings and Google’s storage policies apply to the analytics data stored by that service. Crash logs and aggregated analytics are retained as needed to debug and improve the app.</p>
        <p class="muted">If you request deletion of data we hold directly (support emails, exported logs that include your email), we will delete such data subject to verification and any legal exceptions.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="choices">
        <h2>6. Your choices & how to opt out</h2>

        <h3>Analytics</h3>
        <p>
          If you prefer not to allow Firebase analytics collection, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uninstall the App to stop data collection by the App on that device.</li>
          <li>Use device-level or Google account privacy controls where available; some SDKs also support opt-out flags the developer can implement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ads personalization & Advertising ID</h3>
        <p>To control or reset your Android Advertising ID and ad personalization:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Open your device <em>Settings → Privacy → Ads</em> (or similar) to reset or delete the advertising ID.</li>
          <li>Manage ad personalization at <a href="https://adssettings.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Ad Settings</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="muted">For iOS devices, App Tracking Transparency (ATT) controls whether an app may track you across apps and websites.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="rights">
        <h2>7. Your privacy rights</h2>
        <p class="muted">Below are common rights available under laws like the GDPR and CCPA. Availability depends on your jurisdiction.</p>

          <li><strong>Erasure (“Right to be forgotten”):</strong> request deletion of your personal data where applicable;</li>
          <li><strong>Restriction / objection:</strong> ask us to stop or limit certain processing (e.g., profiling for ads);</li>
          <li><strong>Data portability:</strong> request a machine-readable copy of data you provided;</li>
          <li><strong>Withdraw consent:</strong> where processing is based on consent, you may withdraw it at any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>CCPA (California residents)</h3>

      </section>

      <section id="security">
        <h2>8. Security</h2>
        <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect data. Examples include access controls, using secure transport (HTTPS) for network transmission, and relying on reputable third-party providers with their own security programs.</p>
        <p class="muted">No system is 100% secure—if a breach affects your data we will follow legal obligations to notify affected users and authorities as required.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="children">
        <h2>9. Children</h2>
        <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have collected such information, contact us and we will remove it.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="international">
        <h2>10. International transfers</h2>
        <p>Data processed by third-party service providers (e.g., Google/Firebase) may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries other than your own. By using the App you consent to such transfers and processing under the third-party providers’ terms and applicable law.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="changes">
        <h2>11. Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy occasionally. If we make material changes we will update the effective date at the top and, where required by law, provide notice inside the App or by email (if you provided an email address).</p>
